        p Ever wanted to share that awesome 500pp score you (or someone you admire) did but thought the osu result screen is too big to screenshot, or maybe you need to put the picure on some place where you have less space?
        p.text-center.kek Look no further! This is the tool for you!
        #sample-img
            p.text-center Simply enter some details and get a nice picture generated just for you! An example would be this:
            img.img-responsive.score.center-block(src='/images/sample.png')

                small Oh btw, if it fails (because username or beatmap id doesnt exist, or something blew up) there isn't a whole lot here that shows something went wrong. If nothing happens within a few seconds, it probably failed because &lt;insert random reason&gt;.
