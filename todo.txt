TODO
- option to paste in beatmap-uri
- ajax-load beatmap-info and show beatmap-info on page
  * yay its now in cache, image gen will be faster :D xD
  * could do a thing where if you paste in a set-id, you get a "popup" asking wich diff?
  * just fancy
- to do above two: need UI change, not sure how im gonna do that
- handle multiple scores per beatmap per user
- prolly other shit
- somehow "log" something when a thing gets created
  * ip / user-agent / maybe other client-specific crap
  * the id
  * datetime


DONE
- add meta tags n stuff
- do caching shit (api and image counter)
- contact page
  * link to contact page: get param with the img-id so if user reports problem I know what img-id it is
- refresh image counter when pressing back (or even just whenever with ajax crap)
